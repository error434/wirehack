About Pillow
============

Goals
-----

The fork author's goal is to foster and support active development of PIL through:

- Continuous integration testing via `Travis CI`_
- Publicized development activity on `GitHub`_
- Regular releases to the `Python Package Index`_

.. _Travis CI: https://travis-ci.org/python-pillow/Pillow
.. _GitHub: https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow
.. _Python Package Index: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow

Why a fork?
-----------

PIL is not setuptools compatible. Please see `this Image-SIG post`_ for a more detailed explanation. Also, PIL's current bi-yearly (or greater) release schedule is too infrequent to accommodate the large number and frequency of issues reported.

What about PIL?
---------------

.. note::

    Prior to Pillow 2.0.0, very few image code changes were made. Pillow 2.0.0
    added Python 3 support and includes many bug fixes from many contributors.

As more time passes since the last PIL release, the likelihood of a new PIL release decreases. However, we've yet to hear an official "PIL is dead" announcement. So if you still want to support PIL, please `report issues here first`_, then `open corresponding Pillow tickets here`_.

.. _report issues here first: https://bitbucket.org/effbot/pil-2009-raclette/issues

.. _open corresponding Pillow tickets here: https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow/issues

Please provide a link to the first ticket so we can track the issue(s) upstream.
