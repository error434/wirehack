Installing Packages
*******************

pip supports installing from `PyPI`_, version control, local projects, and
directly from distribution files.


The most common scenario is to install from `PyPI`_ using :ref:`Requirement
Specifiers`

  ::

  $ pip install SomePackage            # latest version
  $ pip install SomePackage==1.0.4     # specific version
  $ pip install 'SomePackage>=1.0.4'     # minimum version


For more information and examples, see the :ref:`pip install` reference.


.. _`Requirements Files`:

Requirements Files
******************

"Requirements files" are files containing a list of items to be
installed using :ref:`pip install` like so:

 ::

   pip install -r requirements.txt


Details on the format of the files are here: :ref:`Requirements File Format`.

Logically, a Requirements file is just a list of :ref:`pip install` arguments
placed in a file.

In practice, there are 4 common uses of Requirements files:

1. Requirements files are used to hold the result from :ref:`pip freeze` for the
   purpose of achieving :ref:`repeatable installations <Repeatability>`.  In
   this case, your requirement file contains a pinned version of everything that
   was installed when `pip freeze` was run.

   ::

     pip freeze > requirements.txt
     pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Requirements files are used to force pip to properly resolve dependencies.
   As it is now, pip `doesn't have true dependency resolution
   <https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/988>`_, but instead simply uses the first
   specification it finds for a project. E.g if `pkg1` requires `pkg3>=1.0` and
   `pkg2` requires `pkg3>=1.0,<=2.0`, and if `pkg1` is resolved first, pip will
   only use `pkg3>=1.0`, and could easily end up installing a version of `pkg3`
   that conflicts with the needs of `pkg2`.  To solve this problem, you can
   place `pkg3>=1.0,<=2.0` (i.e. the correct specification) into your
   requirements file directly along with the other top level requirements. Like
   so:

   ::

     pkg1
     pkg2
     pkg3>=1.0,<=2.0


3. Requirements files are used to force pip to install an alternate version of a
   sub-dependency.  For example, suppose `ProjectA` in your requirements file
   requires `ProjectB`, but the latest version (v1.3) has a bug, you can force
   pip to accept earlier versions like so:

   ::

     ProjectA
     ProjectB<1.3

4. Requirements files are used to override a dependency with a local patch that
   lives in version control.  For example, suppose a dependency,
   `SomeDependency` from PyPI has a bug, and you can't wait for an upstream fix.
   You could clone/copy the src, make the fix, and place it in vcs with the tag
   `sometag`.  You'd reference it in your requirements file with a line like so:

   ::

     git+https://myvcs.com/some_dependency@sometag#egg=SomeDependency

   If `SomeDependency` was previously a top-level requirement in your
   requirements file, then **replace** that line with the new line. If
   `SomeDependency` is a sub-dependency, then **add** the new line.


It's important to be clear that pip determines package dependencies using
`install_requires metadata
<http://pythonhosted.org/setuptools/setuptools.html#declaring-dependencies>`_,
not by discovering `requirements.txt` files embedded in projects.

* :ref:`Requirements File Format`
* :ref:`pip freeze`
* `"setup.py vs requirements.txt" (an article by Donald Stufft)
  <https://caremad.io/blog/setup-vs-requirement/>`_


.. _`Constraints Files`:

Constraints Files
*****************

Constraints files are requirements files that only control which version of a
requirement is installed, not whether it is installed or not. Their syntax and
contents is nearly identical to :ref:`Requirements Files`. There is one key
difference: Including a package in a constraints file does not trigger
installation of the package.

Use a constraints file like so:

 ::

   pip install -c constraints.txt

Constraints files are used for exactly the same reason as requirements files
when you don't know exactly what things you want to install. For instance, say
that the "helloworld" package doesn't work in your environment, so you have a
local patched version. Some things you install depend on "helloworld", and some
don't.

One way to ensure that the patched version is used consistently is to
manually audit the dependencies of everything you install, and if "helloworld"
is present, write a requirements file to use when installing that thing.

Constraints files offer a better way: write a single constraints file for your
organisation and use that everywhere. If the thing being installed requires
"helloworld" to be installed, your fixed version specified in your constraints
file will be used.

Constraints file support was added in pip 7.1.

.. _`Installing from Wheels`:

Installing from Wheels
**********************

"Wheel" is a built, archive format that can greatly speed installation compared
to building and installing from source archives. For more information, see the
`Wheel docs <http://wheel.readthedocs.org>`_ ,
`PEP427 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0427>`_, and
`PEP425 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0425>`_

Pip prefers Wheels where they are available. To disable this, use the
:ref:`--no-binary <install_--no-binary>` flag for :ref:`pip install`.

If no satisfactory wheels are found, pip will default to finding source archives.


To install directly from a wheel archive:

::

 pip install SomePackage-1.0-py2.py3-none-any.whl


For the cases where wheels are not available, pip offers :ref:`pip wheel` as a
convenience, to build wheels for all your requirements and dependencies.

:ref:`pip wheel` requires the `wheel package
<https://pypi.python.org/pypi/wheel>`_ to be installed, which provides the
"bdist_wheel" setuptools extension that it uses.

To build wheels for your requirements and all their dependencies to a local directory:

::

 pip install wheel
 pip wheel --wheel-dir=/local/wheels -r requirements.txt


And *then* to install those requirements just using your local directory of wheels (and not from PyPI):

::

 pip install --no-index --find-links=/local/wheels -r requirements.txt


Uninstalling Packages
*********************

pip is able to uninstall most packages like so:

::

 $ pip uninstall SomePackage

pip also performs an automatic uninstall of an old version of a package
before upgrading to a newer version.

For more information and examples, see the :ref:`pip uninstall` reference.


Listing Packages
****************

To list installed packages:

::

  $ pip list
  docutils (0.9.1)
  Jinja2 (2.6)
  Pygments (1.5)
  Sphinx (1.1.2)

To list outdated packages, and show the latest version available:

::

  $ pip list --outdated
  docutils (Current: 0.9.1 Latest: 0.10)
  Sphinx (Current: 1.1.2 Latest: 1.1.3)


To show details about an installed package:

::

  $ pip show sphinx
  ---
  Name: Sphinx
  Version: 1.1.3
  Location: /my/env/lib/pythonx.x/site-packages
  Requires: Pygments, Jinja2, docutils


For more information and examples, see the :ref:`pip list` and :ref:`pip show`
reference pages.


Searching for Packages
**********************

pip can search `PyPI`_ for packages using the ``pip search``
command::

    $ pip search "query"

The query will be used to search the names and summaries of all
packages.

For more information and examples, see the :ref:`pip search` reference.

.. _`Configuration`:

Configuration
*************

.. _config-file:

Config file
------------

pip allows you to set all command line option defaults in a standard ini
style config file.

The names and locations of the configuration files vary slightly across
platforms. You may have per-user, per-virtualenv or site-wide (shared amongst
all users) configuration:

**Per-user**:

* On Unix the default configuration file is: :file:`$HOME/.config/pip/pip.conf`
  which respects the ``XDG_CONFIG_HOME`` environment variable.
* On Mac OS X the configuration file is
  :file:`$HOME/Library/Application Support/pip/pip.conf`.
* On Windows the configuration file is :file:`%APPDATA%\\pip\\pip.ini`.

There are also a legacy per-user configuration file which is also respected,
these are located at:

* On Unix and Mac OS X the configuration file is: :file:`$HOME/.pip/pip.conf`
* On Windows the configuration file is: :file:`%HOME%\\pip\\pip.ini`

You can set a custom path location for this config file using the environment
variable ``PIP_CONFIG_FILE``.

**Inside a virtualenv**:

* On Unix and Mac OS X the file is :file:`$VIRTUAL_ENV/pip.conf`
* On Windows the file is: :file:`%VIRTUAL_ENV%\\pip.ini`

**Site-wide**:

* On Unix the file may be located in :file:`/etc/pip.conf`. Alternatively
  it may be in a "pip" subdirectory of any of the paths set in the
  environment variable ``XDG_CONFIG_DIRS`` (if it exists), for example
  :file:`/etc/xdg/pip/pip.conf`.
* On Mac OS X the file is: :file:`/Library/Application Support/pip/pip.conf`
* On Windows XP the file is:
  :file:`C:\\Documents and Settings\\All Users\\Application Data\\pip\\pip.ini`
* On Windows 7 and later the file is hidden, but writeable at
  :file:`C:\\ProgramData\\pip\\pip.ini`
* Site-wide configuration is not supported on Windows Vista

If multiple configuration files are found by pip then they are combined in
the following order:

1. Firstly the site-wide file is read, then
2. The per-user file is read, and finally
3. The virtualenv-specific file is read.

Each file read overrides any values read from previous files, so if the
global timeout is specified in both the site-wide file and the per-user file
then the latter value is the one that will be used.

The names of the settings are derived from the long command line option, e.g.
if you want to use a different package index (``--index-url``) and set the
HTTP timeout (``--default-timeout``) to 60 seconds your config file would
look like this:

.. code-block:: ini

    [global]
    timeout = 60
    index-url = http://download.zope.org/ppix

Each subcommand can be configured optionally in its own section so that every
global setting with the same name will be overridden; e.g. decreasing the
``timeout`` to ``10`` seconds when running the `freeze`
(`Freezing Requirements <./#freezing-requirements>`_) command and using
``60`` seconds for all other commands is possible with:

.. code-block:: ini

    [global]
    timeout = 60

    [freeze]
    timeout = 10


Boolean options like ``--ignore-installed`` or ``--no-dependencies`` can be
set like this:

.. code-block:: ini

    [install]
    ignore-installed = true
    no-dependencies = yes

To enable the boolean options ``--no-compile`` and ``--no-cache-dir``, falsy
values have to be used:

.. code-block:: ini

    [global]
    no-cache-dir = false

    [install]
    no-compile = no

Appending options like ``--find-links`` can be written on multiple lines:

.. code-block:: ini

    [global]
    find-links =
        http://download.example.com

    [install]
    find-links =
        http://mirror1.example.com
        http://mirror2.example.com


Environment Variables
---------------------

pip's command line options can be set with environment variables using the
format ``PIP_<UPPER_LONG_NAME>`` . Dashes (``-``) have to be replaced with
underscores (``_``).

For example, to set the default timeout::

    export PIP_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT=60

This is the same as passing the option to pip directly::

    pip --default-timeout=60 [...]

To set options that can be set multiple times on the command line, just add
spaces in between values. For example::

    export PIP_FIND_LINKS="http://mirror1.example.com http://mirror2.example.com"

is the same as calling::

    pip install --find-links=http://mirror1.example.com --find-links=http://mirror2.example.com


Config Precedence
-----------------

Command line options have precedence over environment variables, which have precedence over the config file.

Within the config file, command specific sections have precedence over the global section.

Examples:

- ``--host=foo`` overrides ``PIP_HOST=foo``
- ``PIP_HOST=foo`` overrides a config file with ``[global] host = foo``
- A command specific section in the config file ``[<command>] host = bar``
  overrides the option with same name in the ``[global]`` config file section


Command Completion
------------------

pip comes with support for command line completion in bash and zsh.

To setup for bash::

    $ pip completion --bash >> ~/.profile

To setup for zsh::

    $ pip completion --zsh >> ~/.zprofile

Alternatively, you can use the result of the ``completion`` command
directly with the eval function of you shell, e.g. by adding the following to your startup file::

    eval "`pip completion --bash`"



.. _`Fast & Local Installs`:

Fast & Local Installs
*********************

Often, you will want a fast install from local archives, without probing PyPI.

First, download the archives that fulfill your requirements::

$ pip install --download <DIR> -r requirements.txt

Then, install using  :ref:`--find-links <--find-links>` and :ref:`--no-index <--no-index>`::

$ pip install --no-index --find-links=[file://]<DIR> -r requirements.txt


"Only if needed" Recursive Upgrade
**********************************

``pip install --upgrade`` is currently written to perform an eager recursive
upgrade, i.e. it upgrades all dependencies regardless of whether they still
satisfy the new parent requirements.

E.g. supposing:

* `SomePackage-1.0` requires `AnotherPackage>=1.0`
* `SomePackage-2.0` requires `AnotherPackage>=1.0` and `OneMorePoject==1.0`
* `SomePackage-1.0` and `AnotherPackage-1.0` are currently installed
* `SomePackage-2.0` and `AnotherPackage-2.0` are the latest versions available on PyPI.

Running ``pip install --upgrade SomePackage`` would upgrade `SomePackage` *and*
`AnotherPackage` despite `AnotherPackage` already being satisifed.

pip doesn't currently have an option to do an "only if needed" recursive
upgrade, but you can achieve it using these 2 steps::

  pip install --upgrade --no-deps SomePackage
  pip install SomePackage

The first line will upgrade `SomePackage`, but not dependencies like
`AnotherPackage`.  The 2nd line will fill in new dependencies like
`OneMorePackage`.

See :issue:`59` for a plan of making "only if needed" recursive the default
behavior for a new ``pip upgrade`` command.


User Installs
*************

With Python 2.6 came the `"user scheme" for installation
<http://docs.python.org/install/index.html#alternate-installation-the-user-scheme>`_,
which means that all Python distributions support an alternative install
location that is specific to a user.  The default location for each OS is
explained in the python documentation for the `site.USER_BASE
<http://docs.python.org/library/site.html#site.USER_BASE>`_ variable.  This mode
of installation can be turned on by specifying the :ref:`--user
<install_--user>` option to ``pip install``.

Moreover, the "user scheme" can be customized by setting the
``PYTHONUSERBASE`` environment variable, which updates the value of ``site.USER_BASE``.

To install "SomePackage" into an environment with site.USER_BASE customized to '/myappenv', do the following::

    export PYTHONUSERBASE=/myappenv
    pip install --user SomePackage


``pip install --user`` follows four rules:

#. When globally installed packages are on the python path, and they *conflict*
   with the installation requirements, they are ignored, and *not*
   uninstalled.
#. When globally installed packages are on the python path, and they *satisfy*
   the installation requirements, pip does nothing, and reports that
   requirement is satisfied (similar to how global packages can satisfy
   requirements when installing packages in a ``--system-site-packages``
   virtualenv).
#. pip will not perform a ``--user`` install in a ``--no-site-packages``
   virtualenv (i.e. the default kind of virtualenv), due to the user site not
   being on the python path.  The installation would be pointless.
#. In a ``--system-site-packages`` virtualenv, pip will not install a package
   that conflicts with a package in the virtualenv site-packages.  The --user
   installation would lack sys.path precedence and be pointless.


To make the rules clearer, here are some examples:


From within a ``--no-site-packages`` virtualenv (i.e. the default kind)::

  $ pip install --user SomePackage
  Can not perform a '--user' install. User site-packages are not visible in this virtualenv.


From within a ``--system-site-packages`` virtualenv where ``SomePackage==0.3`` is already installed in the virtualenv::

  $ pip install --user SomePackage==0.4
  Will not install to the user site because it will lack sys.path precedence


From within a real python, where ``SomePackage`` is *not* installed globally::

  $ pip install --user SomePackage
  [...]
  Successfully installed SomePackage


From within a real python, where ``SomePackage`` *is* installed globally, but is *not* the latest version::

  $ pip install --user SomePackage
  [...]
  Requirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade)

  $ pip install --user --upgrade SomePackage
  [...]
  Successfully installed SomePackage


From within a real python, where ``SomePackage`` *is* installed globally, and is the latest version::

  $ pip install --user SomePackage
  [...]
  Requirement already satisfied (use --upgrade to upgrade)

  $ pip install --user --upgrade SomePackage
  [...]
  Requirement already up-to-date: SomePackage

  # force the install
  $ pip install --user --ignore-installed SomePackage
  [...]
  Successfully installed SomePackage


.. _`Repeatability`:

Ensuring Repeatability
**********************

Four things are required to fully guarantee a repeatable installation using requirements files.

1. The requirements file was generated by ``pip freeze`` or you're sure it only
   contains requirements that specify a specific version.

2. The installation is performed using :ref:`--no-deps <install_--no-deps>`.
   This guarantees that only what is explicitly listed in the requirements file is
   installed.

3. None of the packages to be installed utilize the setup_requires keyword. See
   :ref:`Controlling setup_requires<controlling-setup-requires>`.

4. The installation is performed against an index or find-links location that is
   guaranteed to *not* allow archives to be changed and updated without a
   version increase.  While this is safe on PyPI, it may not be safe for other
   indices. If you are working with an unsafe index, consider the `peep project
   <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/peep>`_ which offers this feature on top of pip
   using requirements file comments.


.. _PyPI: http://pypi.python.org/pypi/


.. _`Installation Bundle`:

Create an Installation Bundle with Compiled Dependencies
********************************************************

You can create a simple bundle that contains all of the dependencies you wish
to install using::

    $ tempdir=$(mktemp -d /tmp/wheelhouse-XXXXX)
    $ pip wheel -r requirements.txt --wheel-dir=$tempdir
    $ cwd=`pwd`
    $ (cd "$tempdir"; tar -cjvf "$cwd/bundled.tar.bz2" *)

Once you have a bundle, you can then install it using::

    $ tempdir=$(mktemp -d /tmp/wheelhouse-XXXXX)
    $ (cd $tempdir; tar -xvf /path/to/bundled.tar.bz2)
    $ pip install --force-reinstall --ignore-installed --upgrade --no-index --no-deps $tempdir/*
