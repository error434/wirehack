**7.1.2 (2015-08-22)**

* Don't raise an error if pip is not installed when checking for the latest pip
  version.


**7.1.1 (2015-08-20)**

* Check that the wheel cache directory is writable before we attempt to write
  cached files to them.

* Upgrade packaging to 15.3.

  * Normalize post-release spellings for rev/r prefixes.

  * Changed ScriptMaker to work better under Jython.

* Upgrade ipaddress to 1.0.13.


**7.1.0 (2015-06-30)**

  in a distutils configuration file.

* Fixed an issue where the SOABI tags were not correctly being generated on
  Python 3.5.

* Fixed an issue where we were advising windows users to upgrade by directly
  executing pip, when that would always fail on Windows.

* Allow ``~`` to be expanded within a cache directory in all situations.


**7.0.3 (2015-06-01)**

* Fixed a regression where ``--no-cache-dir`` would raise an exception, fixes
  :issue:`2855`.


**7.0.2 (2015-06-01)**

* **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Revert the change (released in v7.0.0) that
  required quoting in requirements files around specifiers containing
  environment markers. (:pull:`2841`)

* **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Revert the accidental introduction of support for
  options interleaved with requirements, version specifiers etc in
  ``requirements`` files. (:pull:`2841`)

* Expand ``~`` in the cache directory when caching wheels, fixes :issue:`2816`.

* Use ``python -m pip`` instead of ``pip`` when recommending an upgrade command
  to Windows users.


**7.0.1 (2015-05-22)**

* Don't build and cache wheels for non-editable installations from VCSs.

* Allow ``--allow-all-external`` inside of a requirements.txt file, fixing a
  regression in 7.0.


**7.0.0 (2015-05-21)**

* **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Removed the deprecated ``--mirror``,
  ``--use-mirrors``, and ``-M`` options.

* **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Removed the deprecated ``zip`` and ``unzip``
  commands.

* **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Removed the deprecated ``--no-install`` and
  ``--no-download`` options.

* **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** No longer implicitly support an insecure origin
  origin, and instead require insecure origins be explicitly trusted with the
  ``--trusted-host`` option.

* **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Removed the deprecated link scraping that attempted
  to parse HTML comments for a specially formatted comment.

* **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Requirements in requirements files containing
  markers must now be quoted due to parser changes from (:pull:`2697`) and
  (:pull:`2725`).  For example, use ``"SomeProject; python_version < '2.7'"``,
  not simply ``SomeProject; python_version < '2.7'``

* Ignores bz2 archives if Python wasn't compiled with bz2 support.
  Fixes :issue:`497`

* Support ``--install-option`` and ``--global-option`` per requirement in
  requirement files (:pull:`2537`)

* Build Wheels prior to installing from sdist, caching them in the pip cache
  directory to speed up subsequent installs. (:pull:`2618`)

* Allow fine grained control over the use of wheels and source builds.
  (:pull:`2699`)

* ``--no-use-wheel`` and ``--use-wheel`` are deprecated in favour of new

* Improve logging when a requirement marker doesn't match your environment
  (:pull:`2735`)

* Removed the temporary modifications (that began in pip v1.4 when distribute
  and setuptools merged) that allowed distribute to be considered a conflict to
  setuptools. ``pip install -U setuptools`` will no longer upgrade "distribute"
  to "setuptools".  Instead, use ``pip install -U distribute`` (:pull:`2767`).

* Only display a warning to upgrade pip when the newest version is a final
  release and it is not a post release of the version we already have
  installed (:pull:`2766`).

  use of an editable (:pull:`2785`).

* Fix an infinite loop when the cache directory is stored on a file system
  which does not support hard links (:pull:`2796`).

* Remove the implicit debug log that was written on every invocation, instead
  users will need to use ``--log`` if they wish to have one (:pull:`2798`).


**6.1.1 (2015-04-07)**

* No longer ignore dependencies which have been added to the standard library,
  instead continue to install them.


**6.1.0 (2015-04-07)**

* Fixes :issue:`2502`. Upgrades were failing when no potential links were found
  for dependencies other than the current installation. (:pull:`2538`)

* Use a smoother progress bar when the terminal is capable of handling it,
  otherwise fallback to the original ASCII based progress bar.

* Display much less output when `pip install` succeeds, because on success,
  users probably don't care about all the nitty gritty details of compiling and
  installing. When `pip install` fails, display the failed install output once
  instead of twice, because once is enough. (:pull:`2487`)

* Upgrade the bundled copy of requests to 2.6.0, fixing CVE-2015-2296.

* Display format of latest package when using ``pip list --outdated``.
  (:pull:`2475`)

  pywin32 prevented uninstallation of pywin32 on Windows. (:pull:`2467`)

* Normalize the ``--wheel-dir`` option, expanding out constructs such as ``~``
  when used (:pull:`2441`).

* Display a warning when an undefined extra has been requested. (:pull:`2142`)

* Speed up installing a directory in certain cases by creating a sdist instead
  of copying the entire directory. (:pull:`2535`)

  dependencies before the projects that depend on them. (:pull:`2616`)

* Skip trying to install libraries which are part of the standard library.
  (:pull:`2636`, :pull:`2602`)

* Support arch specific wheels that are not tied to a specific Python ABI.
  (:pull:`2561`)

* Output warnings and errors to stderr instead of stdout. (:pull:`2543`)

* Adjust the cache dir file checks to only check ownership if the effective
  user is root. (:pull:`2396`)

* Install headers into a per project name directory instead of all of them into
  the root directory when inside of a virtual environment. (:pull:`2421`)


**6.0.8 (2015-02-04)**

* Fix an issue where the ``--download`` flag would cause pip to no longer use
  randomized build directories.

* Fix an issue where pip did not properly unquote quoted URLs which contain
  characters like PEP 440's epoch separator (``!``).

* Fix an issue where distutils installed projects were not actually uninstalled
  and deprecate attempting to uninstall them altogether.

* Retry deleting directories incase a process like an antivirus is holding the
  directory open temporarily.

* Fix an issue where pip would hide the cursor on Windows but would not reshow
  it.

* Fix a regression where Numpy requires a build path without symlinks to
  properly build.

* Fix a broken log message when running ``pip wheel`` without a requirement.

* Don't mask network errors while downloading the file as a hash failure.

* Properly create the state file for the pip version check so it only happens
  once a week.

  items.

* Fix a regression where pip would be unable to successfully uninstall a
  project without a normalized version.


**6.0.6 (2015-01-03)**

* Continue the regression fix from 6.0.5 which was not a complete fix.


**6.0.5 (2015-01-03)**

* Fix a regression with 6.0.4 under Windows where most commands would raise an
  exception due to Windows not having the ``os.geteuid()`` function.


**6.0.4 (2015-01-03)**

* Fix an issue where ANSI escape codes would be used on Windows even though the
  Windows shell does not support them, causing odd characters to appear with
  the progress bar.

* Fix an issue where using -v would cause an exception saying
  ``TypeError: not all arguments converted during string formatting``.

* Fix an issue where using -v with dependency links would cause an exception
  saying ``TypeError: 'InstallationCandidate' object is not iterable``.

* Fix an issue where upgrading distribute would cause an exception saying
  ``TypeError: expected string or buffer``.

* Show a warning and disable the use of the cache directory when the cache
  directory is not owned by the current user, commonly caused by using ``sudo``
  without the ``-H`` flag.

* Update PEP 440 support to handle the latest changes to PEP 440, particularly
  the changes to ``>V`` and ``<V`` so that they no longer imply ``!=V.*``.

* Document the default cache directories for each operating system.

* Create the cache directory when the pip version check needs to save to it
  instead of silently logging an error.

* Fix a regression where the ``-q`` flag would not properly suppress the
  display of the progress bars.


**6.0.3 (2014-12-23)**

* Fix an issue where the implicit version check new in pip 6.0 could cause pip
  to block for up to 75 seconds if PyPI was not accessible.

* Make ``--no-index`` imply ``--disable-pip-version-check``.


**6.0.2 (2014-12-23)**

* Fix an issue where the output saying that a package was installed would
  report the old version instead of the new version during an upgrade.

* Fix left over merge conflict markers in the documentation.

* Document the backwards incompatible PEP 440 change in the 6.0.0 changelog.


**6.0.1 (2014-12-22)**

* Fix executable file permissions for Wheel files when using the distutils
  scripts option.

* Fix a confusing error message when an exceptions was raised at certain
  points in pip's execution.

* Fix the missing list of versions when a version cannot be found that matches
  the specifiers.

* Add a warning about the possibly problematic use of > when the given
  specifier doesn't match anything.

  directories which were being excluded, however some build systems rely on
  them.

* **PROCESS** Version numbers are now simply ``X.Y`` where the leading ``1``
  has been dropped.

* **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Dropped support for Python 3.1.

  rooted at the location reported by show, rather than one (unstated)
  directory lower. (:pull:`1933`)

* **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** The ability to install files over the FTP protocol
  was accidently lost in pip 1.5 and it has now been decided to not restore
  that ability.

* **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** PEP 440 is now fully implemented, this means that
  in some cases versions will sort differently or version specifiers will be
  interpreted differently than previously. The common cases should all function
  similarly to before.

* **DEPRECATION** ``pip install --download-cache`` and
  ``pip wheel --download-cache`` command line flags have been deprecated and
  the functionality removed. Since pip now automatically configures and uses
  it's internal HTTP cache which supplants the ``--download-cache`` the
  existing options have been made non functional but will still be accepted
  until their removal in pip v8.0. For more information please see
  https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install.html#caching

* **DEPRECATION** ``pip install --build`` and ``pip install --no-clean`` are now
  *NOT* deprecated.  This reverses the deprecation that occurred in v1.5.3. See
  :issue:`906` for discussion.

* **DEPRECATION** Implicitly accessing URLs which point to an origin which is
  not a secure origin, instead requiring an opt-in for each host using the new
  ``--trusted-host`` flag (``pip install --trusted-host example.com foo``).

  convince some servers who double compress the downloaded file to stop doing
  so. (:pull:`1688`)

* Fixed :issue:`1559`. Stop breaking when given pip commands in uppercase (:pull:`1725`)

* Fixed :issue:`1618`. Pip no longer adds duplicate logging consumers, so it
  won't create duplicate output when being called multiple times. (:pull:`1723`)

* Fixed :issue:`1769`. `pip wheel` now returns an error code if any wheels
  fail to build.

* Fixed :issue:`1775`. `pip wheel` wasn't building wheels for dependencies of
  editable requirements.

* Allow the use of ``--no-use-wheel`` within a requirements file. (:pull:`1859`)

* Fixed :issue:`1680`. Attempt to locate system TLS certificates to use instead
  of the included CA Bundle if possible. (:pull:`1866`)

* Fixed :issue:`1885`. Properly handle extras when a project is installed
  via Wheel. (:pull:`1896`)

* Fixed :issue:`1180`. Added support to respect proxies in ``pip search``. It
  also fixes :issue:`932` and :issue:`1104`. (:pull:`1902`)

* Fixed :issue:`798` and :issue:`1060`. `pip install --download` works with vcs links.
  (:pull:`1926`)

* Fixed :issue:`1456`. Disabled warning about insecure index host when using localhost.
  Based off of Guy Rozendorn's work in :pull:`1718`. (:pull:`1967`)

* Allow the use of OS standard user configuration files instead of ones simply
  based around ``$HOME``. (:pull:`2021`)

* Fixed :issue:`1825`. When installing directly from wheel paths or urls,
  previous versions were not uninstalled. This also fixes :issue:`804`
  specifically for the case of wheel archives. (:pull:`1838`)

* Fixed :issue:`2075`, detect the location of the ``.egg-info`` directory by
  looking for any file located inside of it instead of relying on the record
  file listing a directory. (:pull:`2076`)

* Fixed :issue:`1964`, :issue:`1935`, :issue:`676`, Use a randomized and secure
  default build directory when possible. (:pull:`2122`, CVE-2014-8991)

  (:pull:`1457`)


**1.5 (2014-01-01)**


* **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** pip no longer supports the ``--use-mirrors``,
  ``-M``, and ``--mirrors`` flags. The mirroring support has been removed. In
  order to use a mirror specify it as the primary index with ``-i`` or
  ``--index-url``, or as an additional index with ``--extra-index-url``. (:pull:`1098`, CVE-2013-5123)

* **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** pip no longer will scrape insecure external urls by
  default nor will it install externally hosted files by default. Users may opt
  into installing externally hosted or insecure files or urls using
  ``--allow-external PROJECT`` and ``--allow-unverified PROJECT``. (:pull:`1055`)

* **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** pip no longer respects dependency links by default.
  Users may opt into respecting them again using ``--process-dependency-links``.

* **DEPRECATION** ``pip install --no-install`` and ``pip install
  --no-download`` are now formally deprecated.  See :issue:`906` for discussion on

  unintentionally broke in v0.8.3 when fixing :issue:`14` (:pull:`1352`).

* Fixed a bug where global scripts were being removed when uninstalling --user
  installed packages (:pull:`1353`).

  editable option. ( :pull:`1082` )

* Fixed :issue:`1192`. "TypeError: bad operand type for unary" in some cases when
  installing wheels using --find-links (:pull:`1218`).

* Fixed :issue:`1133` and :issue:`317`. Archive contents are now written based on system
  defaults and umask (i.e. permissions are not preserved), except that regular
  files with any execute permissions have the equivalent of "chmod +x" applied
  after being written (:pull:`1146`).

* PreviousBuildDirError now returns a non-zero exit code and prevents the
  previous build dir from being cleaned in all cases (:pull:`1162`).

* Renamed --allow-insecure to --allow-unverified, however the old name will
  continue to work for a period of time (:pull:`1257`).

* Fixed :issue:`1006`, error when installing local projects with symlinks in
  Python 3. (:pull:`1311`)

* The previously hidden ``--log-file`` otion, is now shown as a general option.
  (:pull:`1316`)


**1.4.1 (2013-08-07)**


* **New Signing Key** Release 1.4.1 is using a different key than normal with
  fingerprint: 7C6B 7C5D 5E2B 6356 A926 F04F 6E3C BCE9 3372 DCFA

**1.4 (2013-07-23)**


* **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** pip now only installs stable versions by default,
  and offers a new ``--pre`` option to also find pre-release and development
  versions. (:pull:`834`)

* **BACKWARD INCOMPATIBLE** Dropped support for Python 2.5. The minimum
  supported Python version for pip 1.4 is Python 2.6.

* Added support for installing and building wheel archives.
  Thanks Daniel Holth, Marcus Smith, Paul Moore, and Michele Lacchia
  (:pull:`845`)

* Applied security patch to pip's ssl support related to certificate DNS
  wildcard matching (http://bugs.python.org/issue17980).

* To satisfy pip's setuptools requirement, pip now recommends setuptools>=0.8,
  not distribute. setuptools and distribute are now merged into one project
  called 'setuptools'. (:pull:`1003`)

* pip will now warn when installing a file that is either hosted externally to
  the index or cannot be verified with a hash. In the future pip will default
  to not installing them and will require the flags --allow-external NAME, and
  --allow-insecure NAME respectively. (:pull:`985`)

* If an already-downloaded or cached file has a bad hash, re-download it rather
  than erroring out. (:issue:`963`).

* ``pip bundle`` and support for installing from pybundle files is now
  considered deprecated and will be removed in pip v1.5.

* Fixed a number of issues (:issue:`413`, :issue:`709`, :issue:`634`, :issue:`602`, and :issue:`939`) related to
  cleaning up and not reusing build directories. (:pull:`865`, :issue:`948`)

  Thanks Hugo Lopes Tavares and Kelsey Hightower (:pull:`872`).

* "Vendorized" distlib as pip.vendor.distlib (https://distlib.readthedocs.org/).

* Fixed git VCS backend with git 1.8.3. (:pull:`967`)


**1.3.1 (2013-03-08)**


* Fixed a major backward incompatible change of parsing URLs to externally
  hosted packages that got accidentily included in 1.3.


**1.3 (2013-03-07)**


* SSL Cert Verification; Make https the default for PyPI access.
  Thanks James Cleveland, Giovanni Bajo, Marcus Smith and many others (:pull:`791`, CVE-2013-1629).

  available. Thanks Rafael Caricio, Miguel Araujo, Dmitry Gladkov (:pull:`752`)

* Fixed security issues with pip's use of temp build directories.
  Thanks David (d1b) and Thomas Guttler. (:pull:`780`, CVE-2013-1888)

* Improvements to sphinx docs and cli help. (:pull:`773`)

* Fixed :issue:`707`, dealing with OS X temp dir handling, which was causing
  global NumPy installs to fail. (:pull:`768`)

* Split help output into general vs command-specific option groups.
  Thanks Georgi Valkov. (:pull:`744`; :pull:`721` contains preceding refactor)

* Fixed dependency resolution when installing from archives with uppercase
  project names. (:pull:`724`)

* Fixed problem where re-installs always occurred when using file:// find-links.
  (Pulls :issue:`683`/:issue:`702`)

* "pip install -v" now shows the full download url, not just the archive name.
  Thanks Marc Abramowitz (:pull:`687`)

* Fix to prevent unnecessary PyPI redirects. Thanks Alex Gronholm (:pull:`695`)

* Fixed :issue:`670` - install failure under Python 3 when the same version
  of a package is found under 2 different URLs.  Thanks Paul Moore (:pull:`671`)

* Fix git submodule recursive updates.  Thanks Roey Berman. (Pulls :issue:`674`)

* Explicitly ignore rel='download' links while looking for html pages.
  Thanks Maxime R. (:pull:`677`)

* --user/--upgrade install options now work together. Thanks 'eevee' for
  discovering the problem. (:pull:`705`)

  file already exists. Thanks Andrey Bulgakov. (:pull:`669`)

* Added support for bare paths (including relative paths) as argument to
  `--find-links`. Thanks Paul Moore for draft patch.

* Added support for --no-index in requirements files.

* Added "pip show" command to get information about an installed package.
  Fixes :issue:`131`. Thanks Kelsey Hightower and Rafael Caricio.

* Added `--root` option for "pip install" to specify root directory. Behaves
  like the same option in distutils but also plays nice with pip's egg-info.
  Thanks Przemek Wrzos.  (:issue:`253` / :pull:`693`)


**1.2.1 (2012-09-06)**


* Fixed a regression introduced in 1.2 about raising an exception when
  not finding any files to uninstall in the current environment. Thanks for
  the fix, Marcus Smith.


**1.2 (2012-09-01)**


* **Dropped support for Python 2.4** The minimum supported Python version is
  now Python 2.5.

* Fixed :issue:`605` - pypi mirror support broken on some DNS responses. Thanks
  philwhin.

* Fixed :issue:`355` - pip uninstall removes files it didn't install. Thanks
  pjdelport.

* Fixed issues :issue:`493`, :issue:`494`, :issue:`440`, and :issue:`573` related to improving support for the
  user installation scheme. Thanks Marcus Smith.

* Write failure log to temp file if default location is not writable. Thanks
  andreigc.

* Pull in submodules for git editable checkouts. Fixes :issue:`289` and :issue:`421`. Thanks
  Hsiaoming Yang and Markus Hametner.

* Use a temporary directory as the default build location outside of a
  virtualenv. Fixes issues :issue:`339` and :issue:`381`. Thanks Ben Rosser.

* Added support for specifying extras with local editables. Thanks Nick
  Stenning.

* Added ``--egg`` flag to request egg-style rather than flat installation. Refs
  :issue:`3`. Thanks Kamal Bin Mustafa.

* Fixed :issue:`510` - prevent e.g. ``gmpy2-2.0.tar.gz`` from matching a request
  to ``pip install gmpy``; sdist filename must begin with full project name
  followed by a dash. Thanks casevh for the report.

* Fixed :issue:`504` - allow package URLS to have querystrings. Thanks W.
  Trevor King.

* Fixed :issue:`58` - pip freeze now falls back to non-editable format rather
  than blowing up if it can't determine the origin repository of an editable.
  Thanks Rory McCann.

* Added a `__main__.py` file to enable `python -m pip` on Python versions
  that support it. Thanks Alexey Luchko.

* Fixed :issue:`487` - upgrade from VCS url of project that does exist on
  index. Thanks Andrew Knapp for the report.

* Fixed :issue:`486` - fix upgrade from VCS url of project with no distribution
  on index.  Thanks Andrew Knapp for the report.

* Fixed :issue:`427` - clearer error message on a malformed VCS url. Thanks
  Thomas Fenzl.

* Added support for using any of the built in guaranteed algorithms in
  ``hashlib`` as a checksum hash.

* Fixed :issue:`321` - Raise an exception if current working directory can't be
  found or accessed.

* Fixed :issue:`82` - Removed special casing of the user directory and use the
  Python default instead.

* Fixed :issue:`436` - Only warn about version conflicts if there is actually one.
  This re-enables using ``==dev`` in requirements files.

* Moved tests to be run on Travis CI: http://travis-ci.org/pypa/pip

* Added a better help formatter.


**1.1 (2012-02-16)**


* Fixed :issue:`326` - don't crash when a package's setup.py emits UTF-8 and
  then fails. Thanks Marc Abramowitz.

* Added ``--target`` option for installing directly to arbitrary directory.
  Thanks Stavros Korokithakis.

* Added support for authentication with Subversion repositories. Thanks
  Qiangning Hong.

* Fixed :issue:`315` - ``--download`` now downloads dependencies as well.
  Thanks Qiangning Hong.

* Errors from subprocesses will display the current working directory.
  Thanks Antti Kaihola.

* Fixed :issue:`369` - compatibility with Subversion 1.7. Thanks Qiangning
  Hong. Note that setuptools remains incompatible with Subversion 1.7; to
  get the benefits of pip's support you must use Distribute rather than
  setuptools.

* Fixed :issue:`57` - ignore py2app-generated OS X mpkg zip files in finder.
  Thanks Rene Dudfield.

* Fixed :issue:`182` - log to ~/Library/Logs/ by default on OS X framework
  installs. Thanks Dan Callahan for report and patch.

* Fixed :issue:`310` - understand version tags without minor version ("py3")
  in sdist filenames. Thanks Stuart Andrews for report and Olivier Girardot for
  patch.

* Fixed :issue:`7` - Pip now supports optionally installing setuptools
  "extras" dependencies; e.g. "pip install Paste[openid]". Thanks Matt Maker
  and Olivier Girardot.

* Fixed :issue:`391` - freeze no longer borks on requirements files with
  --index-url or --find-links. Thanks Herbert Pfennig.

* Fixed :issue:`288` - handle symlinks properly. Thanks lebedov for the patch.

* Fixed :issue:`49` - pip install -U no longer reinstalls the same versions of
  packages. Thanks iguananaut for the pull request.

* Removed ``-E``/``--environment`` option and ``PIP_RESPECT_VIRTUALENV``;
  both use a restart-in-venv mechanism that's broken, and neither one is
  useful since every virtualenv now has pip inside it.  Replace ``pip -E
  path/to/venv install Foo`` with ``virtualenv path/to/venv &&
  path/to/venv/pip install Foo``.

* Fixed :issue:`366` - pip throws IndexError when it calls `scraped_rel_links`

* Fixed :issue:`22` - pip search should set and return a userful shell status code

* Fixed :issue:`351` and :issue:`365` - added global ``--exists-action`` command line
  option to easier script file exists conflicts, e.g. from editable
  requirements from VCS that have a changed repo URL.


**1.0.2 (2011-07-16)**


* Fixed docs issues.
* Fixed :issue:`295` - Reinstall a package when using the ``install -I`` option
* Fixed :issue:`283` - Finds a Git tag pointing to same commit as origin/master
* Fixed :issue:`279` - Use absolute path for path to docs in setup.py
* Fixed :issue:`314` - Correctly handle exceptions on Python3.
* Fixed :issue:`320` - Correctly parse ``--editable`` lines in requirements files


**1.0.1 (2011-04-30)**


* Start to use git-flow.
* Fixed :issue:`274` - `find_command` should not raise AttributeError

* Fixed :issue:`233` - pathext handling on Windows.
* Fixed :issue:`252` - svn+svn protocol.
* Fixed :issue:`44` - multiple CLI searches.
* Fixed :issue:`266` - current working directory when running setup.py clean.


**1.0 (2011-04-04)**


* Added Python 3 support! Huge thanks to Vinay Sajip, Vitaly Babiy, Kelsey
  Hightower, and Alex Gronholm, among others.

* Download progress only shown on a real TTY. Thanks Alex Morega.

* Fixed finding of VCS binaries to not be fooled by same-named directories.
  Thanks Alex Morega.

* Fixed uninstall of packages from system Python for users of Debian/Ubuntu
  python-setuptools package (workaround until fixed in Debian and Ubuntu).

* Added `get-pip.py <https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py>`_
  installer. Simply download and execute it, using the Python interpreter of
  your choice::

    $ curl -O https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py
    $ python get-pip.py

  This may have to be run as root.

  .. note::

      Make sure you have `distribute <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/distribute>`_
      installed before using the installer!


**0.8.3**


* Moved main repository to Github: https://github.com/pypa/pip

* Transferred primary maintenance from Ian to Jannis Leidel, Carl Meyer, Brian Rosner

* Fixed bug in Git vcs backend that would break during reinstallation.

* Fixed bug in Mercurial vcs backend related to pip freeze and branch/tag resolution.

* Fixed bug in version string parsing related to the suffix "-dev".


**0.8.2**


* Avoid redundant unpacking of bundles (from pwaller)

* Fixed :issue:`32`, :issue:`150`, :issue:`161` - Fixed checking out the correct
  tag/branch/commit when updating an editable Git requirement.

* Fixed :issue:`49` - Added ability to install version control requirements
  without making them editable, e.g.::

    pip install git+https://github.com/pypa/pip/

* Fixed :issue:`175` - Correctly locate build and source directory on Mac OS X.

* Added ``git+https://`` scheme to Git VCS backend.


**0.8.1**


* Added global --user flag as shortcut for --install-option="--user". From
  Ronny Pfannschmidt.

* Added support for `PyPI mirrors <http://pypi.python.org/mirrors>`_ as
  defined in `PEP 381 <http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0381/>`_, from
  Jannis Leidel.

* Fixed :issue:`138` - Git revisions ignored. Thanks John-Scott Atlakson.

* Fixed :issue:`95` - Initial editable install of github package from a tag fails. Thanks John-Scott Atlakson.

* Fixed :issue:`107` - Can't install if a directory in cwd has the same name as the package you're installing.

* Fixed :issue:`39` - --install-option="--prefix=~/.local" ignored with -e.
  Thanks Ronny Pfannschmidt and Wil Tan.


**0.8**


* Track which ``build/`` directories pip creates, never remove directories
  it doesn't create.  From Hugo Lopes Tavares.

* Pip now accepts file:// index URLs. Thanks Dave Abrahams.

* Various cleanup to make test-running more consistent and less fragile.
  Thanks Dave Abrahams.

* Real Windows support (with passing tests). Thanks Dave Abrahams.

* ``pip-2.7`` etc. scripts are created (Python-version specific scripts)

* ``contrib/build-standalone`` script creates a runnable ``.zip`` form of
  pip, from Jannis Leidel

* Editable git repos are updated when reinstalled

* Fix problem with ``--editable`` when multiple ``.egg-info/`` directories
  are found.

* A number of VCS-related fixes for ``pip freeze``, from Hugo Lopes Tavares.

* Significant test framework changes, from Hugo Lopes Tavares.


**0.7.2**


* Set zip_safe=False to avoid problems some people are encountering where
  pip is installed as a zip file.


**0.7.1**


* Fixed opening of logfile with no directory name. Thanks Alexandre Conrad.

* Temporary files are consistently cleaned up, especially after
  installing bundles, also from Alex Conrad.

* Tests now require at least ScriptTest 1.0.3.


**0.7**


* Fixed uninstallation on Windows
* Added ``pip search`` command.
* Tab-complete names of installed distributions for ``pip uninstall``.
* Support tab-completion when there is a global-option before the
  subcommand.
* Install header files in standard (scheme-default) location when installing
  outside a virtualenv. Install them to a slightly more consistent
  non-standard location inside a virtualenv (since the standard location is
  a non-writable symlink to the global location).
* pip now logs to a central location by default (instead of creating
  ``pip-log.txt`` all over the place) and constantly overwrites the
  file in question. On Unix and Mac OS X this is ``'$HOME/.pip/pip.log'``
  and on Windows it's ``'%HOME%\\pip\\pip.log'``. You are still able to
  override this location with the ``$PIP_LOG_FILE`` environment variable.
  For a complete (appended) logfile use the separate ``'--log'`` command line
  option.
* Fixed an issue with Git that left an editable packge as a checkout of a
  remote branch, even if the default behaviour would have been fine, too.
* Fixed installing from a Git tag with older versions of Git.
* Expand "~" in logfile and download cache paths.
* Speed up installing from Mercurial repositories by cloning without
  updating the working copy multiple times.
* Fixed installing directly from directories (e.g.
  ``pip install path/to/dir/``).
* Fixed installing editable packages with ``svn+ssh`` URLs.
* Don't print unwanted debug information when running the freeze command.
* Create log file directory automatically. Thanks Alexandre Conrad.
* Make test suite easier to run successfully. Thanks Dave Abrahams.
* Fixed "pip install ." and "pip install .."; better error for directory
  without setup.py. Thanks Alexandre Conrad.
* Support Debian/Ubuntu "dist-packages" in zip command. Thanks duckx.
* Fix relative --src folder. Thanks Simon Cross.
* Handle missing VCS with an error message. Thanks Alexandre Conrad.
* Added --no-download option to install; pairs with --no-install to separate
  download and installation into two steps. Thanks Simon Cross.
* Fix uninstalling from requirements file containing -f, -i, or
  --extra-index-url.
* Leftover build directories are now removed. Thanks Alexandre Conrad.


**0.6.3**


* Fixed import error on Windows with regard to the backwards compatibility
  package


**0.6.2**


* Fixed uninstall when /tmp is on a different filesystem.

* Fixed uninstallation of distributions with namespace packages.


**0.6.1**


* Added support for the ``https`` and ``http-static`` schemes to the
  Mercurial and ``ftp`` scheme to the Bazaar backend.

* Fixed uninstallation of scripts installed with easy_install.

* Fixed an issue in the package finder that could result in an
  infinite loop while looking for links.

* Fixed issue with ``pip bundle`` and local files (which weren't being
  copied into the bundle), from Whit Morriss.


**0.6**


* Add ``pip uninstall`` and uninstall-before upgrade (from Carl
  Meyer).

* Extended configurability with config files and environment variables.

* Allow packages to be upgraded, e.g., ``pip install Package==0.1``
  then ``pip install Package==0.2``.

* Allow installing/upgrading to Package==dev (fix "Source version does not
  match target version" errors).

* Added command and option completion for bash and zsh.

* Extended integration with virtualenv by providing an option to
  automatically use an active virtualenv and an option to warn if no active
  virtualenv is found.

* Fixed a bug with pip install --download and editable packages, where
  directories were being set with 0000 permissions, now defaults to 755.

* Fixed uninstallation of easy_installed console_scripts.

* Fixed uninstallation on Mac OS X Framework layout installs

* Fixed bug preventing uninstall of editables with source outside venv.

* Creates download cache directory if not existing.


**0.5.1**


* Fixed a couple little bugs, with git and with extensions.


**0.5**


* Added ability to override the default log file name (``pip-log.txt``)
  with the environmental variable ``$PIP_LOG_FILE``.

* Made the freeze command print installed packages to stdout instead of
  writing them to a file. Use simple redirection (e.g.
  ``pip freeze > stable-req.txt``) to get a file with requirements.

* Fixed problem with freezing editable packages from a Git repository.

* Added support for base URLs using ``<base href='...'>`` when parsing
  HTML pages.

* Fixed installing of non-editable packages from version control systems.

* Fixed issue with Bazaar's bzr+ssh scheme.

* Added --download-dir option to the install command to retrieve package
  archives. If given an editable package it will create an archive of it.

* Added ability to pass local file and directory paths to ``--find-links``,
  e.g. ``--find-links=file:///path/to/my/private/archive``

* Reduced the amount of console log messages when fetching a page to find a
  distribution was problematic. The full messages can be found in pip-log.txt.

* Added ``--no-deps`` option to install ignore package dependencies

* Added ``--no-index`` option to ignore the package index (PyPI) temporarily

* Fixed installing editable packages from Git branches.

* Fixes freezing of editable packages from Mercurial repositories.

* Fixed handling read-only attributes of build files, e.g. of Subversion and
  Bazaar on Windows.

* When downloading a file from a redirect, use the redirected
  location's extension to guess the compression (happens specifically
  when redirecting to a bitbucket.org tip.gz file).

* Editable freeze URLs now always use revision hash/id rather than tip or
  branch names which could move.

* Fixed comparison of repo URLs so incidental differences such as
  presence/absence of final slashes or quoted/unquoted special
  characters don't trigger "ignore/switch/wipe/backup" choice.

* Fixed handling of attempt to checkout editable install to a
  non-empty, non-repo directory.


**0.4**


* Make ``-e`` work better with local hg repositories

* Construct PyPI URLs the exact way easy_install constructs URLs (you
  might notice this if you use a custom index that is
  slash-sensitive).

* Improvements on Windows (from `Ionel Maries Cristian
  <http://ionelmc.wordpress.com/>`_).

* Fixed problem with not being able to install private git repositories.

* Make ``pip zip`` zip all its arguments, not just the first.

* Fix some filename issues on Windows.

* Allow the ``-i`` and ``--extra-index-url`` options in requirements
  files.

* Fix the way bundle components are unpacked and moved around, to make
  bundles work.

* Adds ``-s`` option to allow the access to the global site-packages if a
  virtualenv is to be created.

* Fixed support for Subversion 1.6.


**0.3.1**


* Improved virtualenv restart and various path/cleanup problems on win32.

* Fixed a regression with installing from svn repositories (when not
  using ``-e``).

* Fixes when installing editable packages that put their source in a
  subdirectory (like ``src/``).

* Improve ``pip -h``


**0.3**


* Added support for editable packages created from Git, Mercurial and Bazaar
  repositories and ability to freeze them. Refactored support for version
  control systems.

* Do not use ``sys.exit()`` from inside the code, instead use a
  return.  This will make it easier to invoke programmatically.

* Put the install record in ``Package.egg-info/installed-files.txt``
  (previously they went in
  ``site-packages/install-record-Package.txt``).

* Fix a problem with ``pip freeze`` not including ``-e svn+`` when an
  svn structure is peculiar.

* Allow ``pip -E`` to work with a virtualenv that uses a different
  version of Python than the parent environment.

* Fixed Win32 virtualenv (``-E``) option.

* Search the links passed in with ``-f`` for packages.

* Detect zip files, even when the file doesn't have a ``.zip``
  extension and it is served with the wrong Content-Type.

* Installing editable from existing source now works, like ``pip
  install -e some/path/`` will install the package in ``some/path/``.
  Most importantly, anything that package requires will also be
  installed by pip.

* Add a ``--path`` option to ``pip un/zip``, so you can avoid zipping
  files that are outside of where you expect.

* Add ``--simulate`` option to ``pip zip``.


**0.2.1**


* Fixed small problem that prevented using ``pip.py`` without actually
  installing pip.

* Fixed ``--upgrade``, which would download and appear to install
  upgraded packages, but actually just reinstall the existing package.

* Fixed Windows problem with putting the install record in the right
  place, and generating the ``pip`` script with Setuptools.

* Download links that include embedded spaces or other unsafe
  characters (those characters get %-encoded).

* Fixed use of URLs in requirement files, and problems with some blank
  lines.

* Turn some tar file errors into warnings.


**0.2**


* Renamed to ``pip``, and to install you now do ``pip install
  PACKAGE``

* Added command ``pip zip PACKAGE`` and ``pip unzip PACKAGE``.  This
  is particularly intended for Google App Engine to manage libraries
  to stay under the 1000-file limit.

* Some fixes to bundles, especially editable packages and when
  creating a bundle using unnamed packages (like just an svn
  repository without ``#egg=Package``).


**0.1.4**


* Added an option ``--install-option`` to pass options to pass
  arguments to ``setup.py install``

* ``.svn/`` directories are no longer included in bundles, as these
  directories are specific to a version of svn -- if you build a
  bundle on a system with svn 1.5, you can't use the checkout on a
  system with svn 1.4.  Instead a file ``svn-checkout.txt`` is
  included that notes the original location and revision, and the
  command you can use to turn it back into an svn checkout.  (Probably
  unpacking the bundle should, maybe optionally, recreate this
  information -- but that is not currently implemented, and it would
  require network access.)

* Avoid ambiguities over project name case, where for instance
  MyPackage and mypackage would be considered different packages.
  This in particular caused problems on Macs, where ``MyPackage/`` and
  ``mypackage/`` are the same directory.

* Added support for an environmental variable
  ``$PIP_DOWNLOAD_CACHE`` which will cache package downloads, so
  future installations won't require large downloads.  Network access
  is still required, but just some downloads will be avoided when
  using this.


**0.1.3**


* Always use ``svn checkout`` (not ``export``) so that
  ``tag_svn_revision`` settings give the revision of the package.

* Don't update checkouts that came from ``.pybundle`` files.


**0.1.2**


* Improve error text when there are errors fetching HTML pages when
  seeking packages.

* Improve bundles: include empty directories, make them work with
  editable packages.

* If you use ``-E env`` and the environment ``env/`` doesn't exist, a
  new virtual environment will be created.

* Fix ``dependency_links`` for finding packages.


**0.1.1**


* Fixed a NameError exception when running pip outside of a
  virtualenv environment.

* Added HTTP proxy support (from Prabhu Ramachandran)

* Fixed use of ``hashlib.md5`` on python2.5+ (also from Prabhu
  Ramachandran)


**0.1**


* Initial release
